# Travelling Salesman Problem - Greedy Algorithm

Simple Java implementation of the TSP using a greedy algorithm (nearest-neighbor).

## Algorithm

The greedy algorithm:
1. Start at the first city
2. Always go to the nearest unvisited city
3. Return to the starting city

## How to Run

```bash
# Build and test
./gradlew build

# Run the program
./gradlew run
```
